  "story": "Based on a real life incident. Once there was a man named Suraj. He lived in a city, but his family lived in a small village called Devpur in Maharashtra. Devpur was a peaceful village where everyone knew each other. But everyone in the village was scared of one thing: the old forest nearby.@People said strange things happened in that forest at night. Weird noises came from there, and sometimes, people who went into the forest never came back! Why was everyone so scared? What was in the Devpur forest?@The villagers were scared of something called a Hardal. A Hardal is said to be the spirit or ghost of a woman who dies sadly soon after having a baby. People say these spirits live in certain parts of the forest.@Suraj was a school teacher. He grew up in the city, so he didn't visit his village often. This time, he came for a long holiday, about 20 days. He wanted to relax in his village with his mother, father, and younger brother, Ravi.@One day, Suraj's father and Ravi were out. Suraj's mother asked him, 'Son, please go to the forest and get some wood for the fire.'@'Okay, Mom, I'll go now,' Suraj said.@Suraj went towards the forest, but because he didn't know the village paths well, he started walking towards a part of the forest where people didn't even go during the day!@Suraj was walking on a small path. An old man from the village saw him. The old man shouted, 'Are you crazy? Where are you going? That's the Hardal's path!'@Suraj looked at him. He had heard of Hardal, but he didn't really believe in it. He just smiled a little and said, 'Hardal's path? What is that?'@The old man said, 'Don't go that way, boy! Change your path!'@Suraj knew the old man was serious. He changed his path and went to get wood from another part of the forest. But now, he was thinking about Hardal. He had heard stories, but he had never seen one. He was curious.@When the old man couldn't see him anymore, Suraj turned back and went to the scary path after all. Maybe he wanted to see if Hardal was real or just a story.@Time passed. Suraj didn't come back. Two, then three hours went by. His mother was very worried. She looked around the village and towards the forest, but she couldn't find him.@Evening came, and it started to get dark. Suraj's mother stood outside the house, very upset. Just then, Suraj's father and Ravi came home.@'What's wrong? Why are you so worried?' they asked.@'I sent Suraj to the forest for wood, but he hasn't come back!' she said.@While they were talking, a few other villagers came. Soon, about 10 or 12 people were there. Everyone heard that Suraj was missing.@The old man who had seen Suraj earlier came forward. He said, 'Suraj was going towards the Hardal's path! I stopped him, but maybe he went back after I left.'@When Suraj's family and the villagers heard this, their faces turned white with fear. Everyone was silent for a moment. The thing they feared the most was the Hardal.@Then, Ravi said strongly, 'No matter what, I will go and find my brother!'@He ran towards the forest. Seeing him go, his father and four or five other villagers followed him to search for Suraj. Ravi was so worried about his brother that he ran ahead of everyone into the forest.@Deep inside the forest, it was very, very quiet, a silence that felt strange and scary. Ravi felt like someone was watching him from behind. When he turned, no one was there. Was it just his mind playing tricks because of the scary stories? Or was something really there?@Then, he heard a sound, like something moving in the grass. He ran towards the sound. There, on the ground, was Suraj! He was not awake properly. His eyes were half open, and he looked very strange, with drool coming from his mouth.@Ravi quickly reached him and checked. Suraj was alive! He tried to help Suraj stand up. Just then, he felt like someone was standing behind him. He quickly turned his head a little and saw a dark shadow. It looked like a person but wasn't human.@Ravi got very scared, but he couldn't leave his brother. He bravely put Suraj on his shoulder. As he started walking back, he smelled something terrible, like something rotten. Suraj was making strange growling sounds. Ravi felt sure that Suraj's eyes were open and looking at him in a weird way. It was very scary, but Ravi kept walking quickly, looking straight ahead, because he had to save his brother.@Somehow, Ravi carried Suraj out of the forest and back home. He laid Suraj down. Suraj had a very high fever and was still not fully awake. His mother brought holy ash and put it on his head and body.@After some rest, Suraj opened his eyes a little. He drank some water. When he was more awake, he said, 'She has come inside me! She is eating me! My body hurts so much!' His voice sounded full of pain, and his mother cried seeing him like this.@A village elder heard him and said, 'The Hardal has affected him. She is inside his body.'@Suraj's parents were shocked and scared. 'What can we do?' they asked.@'We must save him,' the elder said. 'Or he will become like a living body that can't move.'@And that's what was happening. Suraj's body was getting stiff. He could hear and understand, but he couldn't move his arms and legs well. They said Hardal takes away the body's energy, leaving it like a living doll.@The village elders talked. One old man said, 'Only the special Baba can help him.' There was a very wise and powerful Baba (like a holy man or healer) in a village three villages away. The elders said this Baba had helped with a Hardal problem before. He was the only one who could save Suraj.@But it was night now, so they had to wait until morning. All night, everyone watched over Suraj. He was in terrible pain, crying and shouting. Sometimes he screamed so loudly that the whole village could hear him!@Finally, morning came. As soon as the sun's first light arrived, Suraj's father, Ravi, Suraj, and some villagers went to the Baba's place. Suraj couldn't walk well. Ravi and another man carried him, almost dragging his feet on the ground.@When they reached the Baba, Suraj's father told him everything that happened. The Baba said, 'You woke up the Hardal. This boy is like this because the Hardal is in his body. She wants this human body now.' He asked why Suraj went there knowing the danger.@Suraj's father explained that Suraj lived in the city and made a mistake. He begged the Baba to forgive Suraj and save his life.@Suraj was in bad shape from the night's pain. He could barely move. Ravi and the other man were holding him up in front of the Baba. The Baba looked at him and said, 'Come, stand near me.'@Everyone was amazed! Suraj, who couldn't even walk, suddenly stood up by himself from their shoulders and walked straight to the Baba! He stood in front of him, and his face looked strange. He was smiling a big, scary smile.@The Baba pointed, 'Sit here.' Suraj sat down without a problem.@The Baba started saying special prayers or chants. Suraj just sat there, looking at the Baba and the people, smiling like he was saying, 'Do whatever you want, you can't hurt me. I won't leave this body!'@The chanting continued. Then, the Baba got up and brought a small statue from inside his temple. He put the statue in front of Suraj. As soon as the statue was near, Suraj's face changed again. He looked very, very angry. His eyes turned completely black! The white part of his eyes was all black!@He started kicking up dust around him, trying to get out of the circle the Baba had drawn. He wanted to run away! The Baba then took red powder and put it on Suraj's forehead. As soon as the red powder touched him, Suraj screamed a loud, terrifying scream, like an animal! The veins on his neck stuck out, looking like they would burst! His scream was so loud, you could hear it very far away. He was screaming like the red powder was hurting him like hot chili!@After this, the Baba broke the head off the small statue. As soon as the statue broke, Suraj started hitting his head on the ground very hard, two or three times. He hit it so hard that his head broke open, and blood started coming out!@Suraj's father and Ravi were shocked. They wanted to rush forward, but the Baba stopped them. Blood was flowing from Suraj's head, and they were so worried, but Suraj didn't seem to feel the pain at all, just like someone who is given medicine so they don't feel hurt.@The Baba signaled to two or three of his helpers. They went and held Suraj tightly. The Baba took a pot, poured something from it, and made Suraj drink it. Suraj spit it out two times. The third time, they held his mouth closed, and he had to swallow the liquid.@As the liquid went into Suraj's body, he started shaking and struggling violently, like someone poisoned! He thrashed around very hard, but the Baba's helpers held him tightly so he couldn't move much. After about a minute or two, Suraj's body became weak, and he was completely still and quiet.@Then, the Baba told his helpers to wash Suraj and put new clothes on him. They took Suraj to wash him. Something strange happened when they washed him: the water that ran off his body was black! Not clear like normal water, but dark black! Everyone was surprised to see this black color coming off him, but they knew it was part of the spooky thing happening.@After being washed and dressed, Suraj himself got up and went to lie down on a bed there. He fell asleep.@The Baba came back. He took the broken statue and wrapped it in a black cloth. He tied a red thread around it and said some prayers. Then, he gave it to Ravi.@'Ravi, take this statue,' the Baba said. 'Near the river, there is a muddy, swampy place. Take this statue there and bury it deep in the mud. But, my son, listen carefully! When you bury the statue, or when you walk back from there, you will hear voices calling you. It might sound like your mother, your father, or even your brother Suraj! But never look back! If you look back, you will never be able to come home again!'@By now, it was evening, and getting dark. Ravi loved his brother very much. He was determined to do anything to save him. He took the statue and went to the muddy place near the river.@He sat down and started digging a hole for the statue. As he dug, a cold wind hit him, and he felt a shiver deep inside. It felt like a spooky energy was trying to scare him. He knew what the statue was and that the Baba's warning was true. Fear made him dig faster.@He quickly finished digging, put the statue in, and covered it with mud. Then he stood up and started walking back home as fast as he could. As he walked, he felt like many people were walking behind him. He walked even faster.@Then, he heard voices calling his name! 'Ravi! My brother! Are you burying me here? Don't leave me alone! These people will kill me! Take me with you! Don't leave me here!' It sounded exactly like Suraj's voice!@For a moment, Ravi stopped. But then he remembered the Baba's words. He knew it was a trick! He knew that if he turned back, he would never get home, and maybe his brother would not be saved either. He covered his ears and ran as fast as he could!@He ran and ran without looking back until he was out of the forest, away from the river, and back in the village where everyone was waiting. He fell to the ground on his knees, tired and scared.@Seeing him, the Baba smiled. He knew Ravi had done the job. The Baba said, 'Good job. Everything will be fine now. Nothing bad will happen to your brother.'@Suraj stayed in the village for a few more days. He didn't remember anything that happened to him during that scary time. His family and Ravi told him the whole story.@When it was time for Suraj to go back to the city, he took one last look at the forest. As he looked, he saw the same black shadow standing right at the edge of the forest! As he watched, the black shadow disappeared into the air.@Suraj felt a shiver inside him. Maybe the shadow was still there, waiting. Suraj quickly turned away and went back to the city.@After that day, Suraj never felt anything strange again. Things were normal for him. But he learned a big lesson: the old stories in the village about that forest were true! Now, Suraj is scared to go back to his village, and most of all, he is scared to look at that forest. He always feels like he might see the Hardal again."
