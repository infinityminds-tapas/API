  "story": "Dyno and Lipun were best friends. One night, they went on a road trip by bike. The road was dark and empty. The wind made a scary sound. Dyno, a photographer, wanted to click pictures of the night.@On the way, they stopped at a small tea stall. An old chai wala with shaking hands said, 'Sahab… don’t go ahead. That road… it’s cursed. No one returns after midnight'. But Lipun laughed, 'Ghosts don’t exist!' and they left.@As they rode ahead, fog covered the road. Suddenly, Dyno saw a white shadow in his camera. But when he looked with his eyes — nothing!@He clicked again. This time, a face with blood-red eyes appeared. Dyno screamed!@The bike stopped on its own. A woman in white was standing in the middle of the road, her head hanging low, hair covering her face.@Slowly, she lifted her head — her mouth was wide open with no tongue inside!@Dyno shouted, 'Lipun, go back!'@They turned the bike, but the road never ended. It kept going in circles. The same tree… the same stone… again and again.@Dyno quickly took out his camera and clicked the ghost’s picture. The ghost screamed and vanished into smoke.@Finally, the road cleared, and they reached the tea stall again. The chai wala smiled sadly and said, 'I warned you…'.@They never took that road again. -End!."
